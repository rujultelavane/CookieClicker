This project was created during my junior year of high school (April 2024). It's meant to recreate the popular Cookie Clicker game (https://cookieclicker.com/), 
However, I added my own spin to it: it's Stray Kids themed!
Stray Kids is my current favorite artist, and it's a K-Pop group.

I replaced the cookie in the original game with the Stray Kids's lightstick globe, AKA the Nachimbong. When you click it, the first note of their song "Back Door" plays.

Hope you enjoy!
